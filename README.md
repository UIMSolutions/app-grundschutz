IT-Grundschutz is a method and a set of standards for information security developed by the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) in Germany¬π¬≤. It provides a systematic approach to identify and implement necessary security measures for data, systems, and information. It also allows institutions to obtain an ISO 27001 certificate based on IT-Grundschutz to demonstrate their compliance with international standards¬π.

IT-Grundschutz consists of the following components¬≤:
- BSI-Standards: These are the main documents that describe the methodology, the risk analysis, and the business continuity management of IT-Grundschutz.
- IT-Grundschutz-Kompendium: This is a collection of modules that cover various aspects of information security, such as infrastructure, organization, personnel, and technology. Each module contains a description, a threat analysis, and a set of recommended measures.
- IT-Grundschutz-Profile: These are predefined sets of modules that are suitable for specific types of institutions, such as small and medium enterprises, public authorities, or health care providers.
- IT-Grundschutz-Tools: These are software applications that support the implementation and management of IT-Grundschutz, such as the GSTOOL, the IT-Grundschutz-Check, or the IT-Grundschutz-Webanwendung.

IT-Grundschutz is a widely used and recognized standard for IT security in Germany and beyond. It helps institutions to achieve a high level of information security and to comply with legal and regulatory requirements¬≤.
